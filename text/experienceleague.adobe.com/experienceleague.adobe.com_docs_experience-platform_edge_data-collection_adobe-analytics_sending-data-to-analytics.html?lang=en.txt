Sending data to Adobe Analytics
Whereas in the past there were different functions to distinguish between a page view and a link (for example, s.t(), s.tl()), in the Web SDK there is just the sendEvent command. The data you send with an event determines whether it should be a page view or a link. Learn more about tracking links.
Sending a page view
You can specify a page view by setting the the web.webPageDetails.pageViews.value=1 variable.
alloy("sendEvent", {
  "xdm": {
    "web": {
      "webPageDetails": {
        "pageViews": {
            "value":1
         }
      }
    }
  }
});

Although Analytics technically records a page view even if this variable is not set, it is a best practice to set this variable whenever you want to record a page view to be explicit in your data and to future proof your implementation.
