Interact with multiple properties
There are certain cases where you might want to interact with two different properties on the same page. These cases include:

Companies that have been acquired and are working on integrating their websites together
Data-sharing relationships between multiple companies
Customers who are testing new Adobe Solutions and donâ€™t want to disrupt their existing implementation

The SDK allows you to create a separate instance for each property by adding another name to the array in the base code. The following example provides two names, mycustomname1 and mycustomname2.
<script>
  !function(n,o){o.forEach(function(o){n[o]||((n.__alloyNS=n.__alloyNS||
  []).push(o),n[o]=function(){var u=arguments;return new Promise(
  function(i,l){n[o].q.push([i,l,u])})},n[o].q=[])})}
  (window,["mycustomname1", "mycustomname2"]);
</script>
<script src="alloy.js" async></script>

As a result, the script creates two instances of the SDK. The global function for interacting with the first instance is named mycustomname1 and the global function for interacting with the second instance is named mycustomname2.
By creating two separate instances, each can be configured for a different property. Any communication or data persistence that occurs due to interacting with mycustomname1 is kept isolated from mycustomname2.
Following the above example, you can execute commands using each of the instances, as follows:
mycustomname1("configure", {
  "edgeConfigId": "ebebf826-a01f-4458-8cec-ef61de241c93",
  "orgId": "ADB3LETTERSANDNUMBERS@AdobeOrg"
});

mycustomname1("sendEvent", {
  "data": {
    "key": "value"
  }
});

mycustomname2("configure", {
  "edgeConfigId": "f46e981f-fd03-4bdd-a9d9-73ce4447f870",
  "orgId": "ADB3NUMBERSANDLETTERS2@AdobeOrg"
});

mycustomname2("sendEvent", {
  "data": {
    "key": "value"
  }
});

Be sure to execute the configure command for each instance before executing other commands on the same instance.
Limitations
To avoid conflicts with cookies, only one instance of Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK within a page can have a particular edgeConfigId. Similarly, only one instance of Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK can have a particular orgId.
