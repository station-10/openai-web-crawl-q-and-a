Accessing the ECID
The Experience Cloud Identity (ECID) is a persistent identifier for a visitor to your website. In certain circumstances, you might prefer to access the ECID (to send it to a third party, for example).
To access the ECID within tags, Adobe recommends the following:


Ensure your property is configured with rule component sequencing enabled.


Create a new rule.


Add a Library Loaded event to the rule.


Add a Custom Condition action to the rule with the following code (assuming the name youâ€™ve configured for the SDK instance is alloy):
 return alloy("getIdentity")
   .then(function(result) {
     _satellite.setVar("ECID", result.identity.ECID);
   });



Save the rule.


You should then be able to access the ECID in subsequent rules using %ECID% or _satellite.getVar("ECID") like you would any other data element.
