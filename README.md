# openai-web-crawl-q-and-a

This is a web crawler that crawls the Adobe AEP Web SDK documentation, converts it to embeddings and uses it for answering questions using OpenAI's GPT-3 API.

It is almost entirely copied from [this example app](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/apps/web-crawl-q-and-a) and [this tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings), with some minor changes.

## How to run

- To run these examples, you'll need an OpenAI account and associated API key [create a free account](https://beta.openai.com/signup).
